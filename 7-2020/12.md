## Retrospective

It seems I traded exercise for reading this week. How can I fit both in the same week?

The average did not change but the spread is much larger. I need to find better ways to fit a more balanced set of activities in a week.

I am starting to wonder if I am trying to meet too much with these goals, or if I am just spending too much time not working on them. Have my values change or am I not taking these goals seriously enough?
