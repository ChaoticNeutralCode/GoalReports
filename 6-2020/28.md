# Goals Report Card - June 28th, 2020

|       Goal     |    Grade    | How to Improve |
| -------------- | ----------- | -------------- |
|    Exercise    |      C      | I will be adjusting the goal to be based on sessions a week vs. hours a week to remove the focus of a specific amount of time to reach each week. |
|     Reading    |      F      | More focus needs to be on reading instead of watching TV during my AFK time. Possibly devote time to AFS, Away from Screen? |
|   Socializing  |      D      | I need to improve my group collaboration skillset. I have trouble conveying intentions and motivations, especially through text. |
|    Learning    |      A      | |
|    Teaching    |      C      | I still need to work on being proactive about creating opportunities for me to teach. |
| Video Creation |      F      | I need stop assuming conflicts of interest or narrow topics and just execute on ideas. At the very least it would be good practice. |
|     Average    |      C      | |

## Retrospective

If I consistantly learn every week, couldn't some of these gain from that learning? Activities such as video creation and teaching can directly tie into what I have learned this or previous weeks.

Reading is a constant failure. I never _want_ to read so I believe I mentally avoid giving myself space to do so. Books are always the last reference I seek out for knowledge or clarification.
