# Self-Improvement/Care Goals

## Overview
The goals outlined in this document were developed over many brainstorming sessions. They are short-term (daily/weekly) activities that help improve and maintain my mental and physical health. I use SMART criteria to develop my goals that are clear and focused. I also made sure most of these goals help me grow not only personally but professionally.

## Tracking
Beyond a basic tracking throughout the day, I will complete weekly “report cards” that outline my compliance to the goals I create for myself. Think of this as a “personal retro” that I perform every week to track successes and failures. These report cards will be published in this repository as they are created.

## Goals

### 3 Sessions / Week of Physical Exercise with No Specific Schedule
There is a ton of research and opinion out there linking physical health with mental health. I want to tap that by committing a number of sessions, of any meaningful length, each week to increasing my physical health. This amount of time will start low, a few hours, but will grow over time. I choose not to make a specific schedule for this because when I force myself to do things at specific times I tend to see lower success.

### 5 Chapters / Week Reading a Book
Reading is not only a fundamental part of learning and growth, but also a great way to stay mentally acute. In the past I have lacked any particular drive to read on a regular basis, preferring video and activity based learning. This lacks the deep understanding you can get by reading and interpreting for yourself. For this goal there are no specific topics I want to target, just time reading a book.

### 1 Night / Week With Friends
Building and maintaining social relationships is not only extremely important from a health perspective, but also helps hone social skill-sets that are useful for a wide variety of situations. It doesn’t really matter what I am doing, so long as it’s at least voice chat.

### 4 Hours / Week Project Work
We all have an incalculable number of random things we want to build. It's the blight of the developer. However, I want to make it  clear that its important to me to set time aside each week to sit down and work on one of my projects. Currently I am unsure if I will make a master priority list to help figure out what to work on, but I want to make sure they, as a whole, are progressing.

### 4 Hours / Week Learning
A simple goal to devote time each week to further my understanding on the various topics I think are important for me to know. This also gives me perspectives into various teaching techniques, styles, and environments. So there are some layered benefits to this.

### 4 Hours / Week Lecturing or Teaching
Nothing can replace the real experience gained teaching live to students. When available I want to make sure I am doing this as often as a can, with this goal providing a good minimum bar. However, I should still be trying to hone this skill any way I can when I don't actually have students to teach. There are many ways to accomplish this. I can record myself doing a lecture, I could lecture for friends, or I could even just lecture to family. The topics don't even have to be technical. As long as I am practicing its valuable.

### 1 Video / Week
I made this goal vague on purpose. It's arguably on the edge of not being SMART, but I want to capture a wish to practice and maintain content creation. This video should be as polished as possible and published publicly. The topics are not outlined here because the most important part with this goal is trying to maintain the schedule.
